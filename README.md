# Task 1: Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the documentation and research for the first milestone of the Cybersecurity Foundation module. The goal of this task is to establish a solid grasp of core security principles, identify the modern threat landscape, and understand how data movement creates potential entry points for attackers.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Primary:** Web Browser (Chrome / Firefox)
* **Resources:** [OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/), [Google Cybersecurity Blog](https://safety.google/cybersecurity-blog/), [CISA Resources](https://www.cisa.gov/)

## 📖 Learning Journey & Methodology

### 1. The CIA Triad
Researching the bedrock of information security:
* **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users (e.g., End-to-end encryption in WhatsApp).
* **Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data (e.g., Preventing unauthorized balance changes in banking apps).
* **Availability:** Ensuring systems are up and running when needed (e.g., Defending against DDoS attacks on social media platforms).

### 2. Threat Actor Profiling
Identifying who launches attacks and their motivations:
* **Script Kiddies:** Unskilled individuals using pre-made tools.
* **Insiders:** Employees or contractors with authorized access who misuse it.
* **Hacktivists:** Actors driven by political or social causes.
* **Nation-State Actors:** Highly sophisticated, government-sponsored groups.

### 3. Attack Surface Exploration
Mapping out the "doors and windows" of an organization:
* **Web & Mobile Apps:** User interfaces and client-side vulnerabilities.
* **APIs:** The bridges between different software components.
* **Network & Cloud:** Infrastructure, servers, and virtualized environments.

### 4. Vulnerability Research
Deep dive into the **OWASP Top 10** to understand critical web application risks, such as Broken Access Control, Cryptographic Failures, and Injection.

## 🔄 Data Flow & Vulnerability Mapping
To understand where attacks occur, I documented the standard data lifecycle:
`User` ➔ `Application Interface` ➔ `Server/API` ➔ `Database`



**Key Attack Points Identified:**
* **User Level:** Phishing, Credential Stuffing.
* **Transit Level:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
* **Server Level:** Logic flaws, Remote Code Execution (RCE).
* **Database Level:** SQL Injection, Data Breaches.

## 🎯 Final Outcome
Achieved a strong foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts and a heightened awareness of how modern digital threats operate.
